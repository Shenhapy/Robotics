for the gravity companesation need to make the following lines
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/open_manipulator_controls.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make

open dynamixel software
(For the master Robot only) (know the both usb prot will use later)
make operation mode to be current control for all joints
(For both robots)
make the joints numbered from 11 -> 15

-to start the slave: (check the usb port id and use the right one)
roslaunch open_manipulator_hw open_manipulator_control.launch __ns:=slave baud_rate:=1000000 usb_port:=/dev/ttyACM0

-to start the launch file we made that will launch the master and make the gravity compansation for it and will start slave controlls (check the usb port id and use the right one)
roslaunch master_slave_new master_slave_new.launch usb_port:=/dev/ttyACM1

-to start our python code (which will make the mimic or record in rosbag)
rosrun master_slave_new final.py
-interact with the terminal for the mimic and trajectory record and play
